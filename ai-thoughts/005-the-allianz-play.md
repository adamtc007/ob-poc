│  • Deadline-driven: Client expectations, competitive pressure              │

## The Risk Framing

For the business leader considering this:

| Risk of Engaging You | Risk of NOT Engaging You |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Unconventional approach | No solution in time |
| Rust instead of Java | Allianz relationship damaged |
| Bypass normal process | Competitors look better |
| Political pushback | "AI transformation" is just words |
| | Public Microsoft partnership = embarrassment |

**The risk of doing nothing is higher than the risk of trying.**

## The "Only Person" Angle

This is a strong card. Play it carefully:

## The Scenarios

### Scenario A: They Engage You

```
• You get air cover
• Demo becomes pilot
• Pilot becomes production
• You're the hero who saved Allianz
• "AI transformation" has a poster child
• Career trajectory: up
```

### Scenario B: They Don't Engage You (and Succeed Without You)

```
• Unlikely - they don't have the capability
• If they do, you learn something
• Your demo still exists for next opportunity
```

### Scenario C: They Don't Engage You (and Fail)

```
• Allianz onboarding is a mess
• Relationship damaged
• Post-mortem happens
• Someone asks "Didn't Adam have something?"
• You're the "I told you so" person
• Not ideal, but you're positioned for next time
```

### Scenario D: They Engage You (and You Fail)

```
• Risk is real
• Mitigate: 90-day checkpoint, clear scope
• Fail fast, fail small, learn
• Still better than 18-month waterfall failure
```

## Next Steps

1. **Identify the business owner** for Allianz onboarding
   - Not the platform team lead
   - The person whose bonus depends on Allianz success

2. **Find the path** to 30 minutes with them
   - Who do you know?
   - Who owes you a favor?
   - Who's frustrated with the platform team?

3. **Prepare the demo**
   - Allianz data loaded ✓
   - 10-minute walkthrough scripted
   - "Here's what we can do in 90 days" slide

4. **Prepare the ask**
   - Air cover
   - One real use case
   - 90 days
   - Clear success criteria

5. **Prepare for pushback**
   - "We have a platform team" → "They're excellent at KYC. This is different."
   - "This isn't standard" → "Neither is 337 entities in 3 months."
   - "What about support?" → "I'll train your team. Or run it."

## Key Quotes

> "Allianz is a major business win for BNY - and the Java shop are never going to be able to even come up with a tactical solution in 3 months."

> "I am (as far as I know) the only single person on that whole onboarding platform who has ever supported a major new client onboarding program."

> "Most of the onboarding platform are KYC - including the engineering rump."

*The best time to solve a problem is before it becomes a crisis. The second best time is when the crisis is visible enough that people will listen.*
