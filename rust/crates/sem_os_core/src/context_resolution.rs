//! Context resolution — pure scoring/ranking/filtering logic.
//!
//! This module contains all the **pure** types and functions from the 12-step
//! context resolution pipeline. The async DB-loading portion (resolve_subject,
//! load_subject_memberships, load_view_defs, load_typed_snapshots, etc.) lives
//! in `sem_os_postgres`.
//!
//! ## 12-Step Resolution Pipeline (pure steps marked ✓)
//!
//! 1. Determine snapshot epoch (trivial)
//! 2. Resolve subject → entity type + jurisdiction + state (DB)
//!    2b. Load taxonomy memberships (DB) + evaluate conditional memberships ✓
//!    2c. Load subject relationships (DB)
//! 3. Select applicable ViewDefs by taxonomy overlap ✓
//! 4. Extract verb_surface + attribute_prominence from top view ✓
//! 5. Filter verbs by taxonomy + ABAC + tier ✓
//! 6. Filter attributes similarly ✓
//! 7. Rank by ViewDef prominence weights ✓
//! 8. Evaluate preconditions ✓
//! 9. Evaluate policies ✓
//! 10. Compute composite access decision ✓
//! 11. Generate governance signals ✓
//! 12. Compute confidence score ✓
