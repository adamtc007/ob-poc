//! `WorkflowExecutionPlan` — the linted, DAG-validated output of the
//! bpmn-dsl compilation pipeline.
//!
//! This is the **bpmn-lite workflow DAG** (Commitment B scope =
//! process-instance, long-lived). It is **not** a Phase 5
//! [`ExecutablePlan`]: those are the inner per-callout plans the bus
//! emits at runtime when a service-task or business-rule-task is
//! dispatched to a receiver domain (ob-poc, dmn-lite, …).
//!
//! Lifecycle (v0.6 §3, T0 audit gap C):
//!
//! ```text
//! bpmn-dsl source
//!     ↓ parse / lint / dag   (workflow-compile-time, this crate)
//! WorkflowExecutionPlan      ←── this module's type
//!     ↓ start process instance (bpmn-lite engine)
//! ProcessInstance
//!     ↓ fire ServiceTaskExecNode N
//!     ↓ bus dispatch to target domain with N's static_args + bound placeholders
//!     ↓ receiver compiles inputs into Phase 5 ExecutablePlan ←── inner plan, NOT this type
//!     ↓ receiver executes ExecutablePlan, returns result
//! ProcessInstance advances to next node
//! ```
//!
//! The workflow plan cannot pre-compile inner ExecutablePlans because
//! placeholder values (`@cbu`, `@cbu-type`) are not known until the
//! upstream node has executed. Inner-plan compilation is a per-callout,
//! submit-time concern owned by the bus path (T2B).
//!
