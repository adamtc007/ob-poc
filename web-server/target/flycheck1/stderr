error: failed to select a version for `libsqlite3-sys`.
    ... required by package `sqlx-sqlite v0.8.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `sqlx-sqlite = "=0.8.0"` of package `sqlx v0.8.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `sqlx = "^0.8"` of package `ob-poc v0.1.0 (/Users/adamtc007/Developer/ob-poc/rust)`
    ... which satisfies path dependency `ob-poc` of package `ob-poc-web-server v0.1.0 (/Users/adamtc007/Developer/ob-poc/web-server)`
versions that meet the requirements `^0.28.0` are: 0.28.0

package `libsqlite3-sys` links to the native library `sqlite3`, but it conflicts with a previous package which links to `sqlite3` as well:
package `libsqlite3-sys v0.26.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `libsqlite3-sys = "^0.26.0"` of package `sqlx-sqlite v0.7.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `sqlx-sqlite = "=0.7.0"` of package `sqlx v0.7.0`
    ... which satisfies dependency `sqlx = "^0.7"` of package `ob-poc-web-server v0.1.0 (/Users/adamtc007/Developer/ob-poc/web-server)`
Only one package in the dependency graph may specify the same links value. This helps ensure that only one copy of a native library is linked in the final binary. Try to adjust your dependencies so that only one package uses the `links = "sqlite3"` value. For more information, see https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/resolver.html#links.
